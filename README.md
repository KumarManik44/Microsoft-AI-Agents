# 11 AI Agents


### What You Need 

Each project in this repository includes code examples, which can be found in the code_samples folder.
The code in these projects, utilize Azure AI Foundry and GitHub Model Catalogs for interacting with Language Models:

- [Github Models](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/github-models) - Free / Limited
- [Azure AI Foundry](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/ai-foundry) - Azure Account Required

This repository also uses the following AI Agent frameworks and services from Microsoft:

- [Azure AI Agent Service](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/ai-agent-service)
- [Semantic Kernel](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/semantic-kernel)
- [AutoGen](https://aka.ms/ai-agents/autogen)

## ðŸ“‚ Each project includes

- A written project located in the README
- Python code samples supporting Azure AI Foundry and Github Models (Free)
- Links to extra resources to continue your learning
