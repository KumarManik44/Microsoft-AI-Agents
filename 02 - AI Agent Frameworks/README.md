# Exploring AI Agent Frameworks

AI agent frameworks are software platforms designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of AI agents. These frameworks provide developers with pre-built components, abstractions, and tools that streamline the development of complex AI systems.

These frameworks help developers focus on the unique aspects of their applications by providing standardized approaches to common challenges in AI agent development. They enhance scalability, accessibility, and efficiency in building AI systems.

## Introduction 

This project will cover:

- What are AI Agent Frameworks and what do they enable developers to achieve?
- How can teams use these to quickly prototype, iterate, and improve their agent‚Äôs capabilities?
- What are the differences between the frameworks and tools created by Microsoft <a href="https://aka.ms/ai-agents/autogen" target="_blank">AutoGen</a> and <a href="https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners/semantic-kernel" target="_blank">Semantic Kernel</a>?
- Can I integrate my existing Azure ecosystem tools directly, or do I need standalone solutions?
- What is Azure AI Agents service and how is this helping me?

## Goals

The goals of this project are to understand:

- The role of AI Agent Frameworks in AI development.
- How to leverage AI Agent Frameworks to build intelligent agents.
- Key capabilities enabled by AI Agent Frameworks.
- The differences between AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and Azure AI Agent Service.

## What are AI Agent Frameworks and what do they enable developers to do?

Traditional AI Frameworks can help you integrate AI into your apps and make these apps better in the following ways:

- **Personalization**: AI can analyze user behavior and preferences to provide personalized recommendations, content, and experiences.
Example: Streaming services like Netflix use AI to suggest movies and shows based on viewing history, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
- **Automation and Efficiency**: AI can automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and improve operational efficiency.
Example: Customer service apps use AI-powered chatbots to handle common inquiries, reducing response times and freeing up human agents for more complex issues.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: AI can improve the overall user experience by providing intelligent features such as voice recognition, natural language processing, and predictive text.
Example: Virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant use AI to understand and respond to voice commands, making it easier for users to interact with their devices.

### That all sounds great right, so why do we need the AI Agent Framework?

AI Agent frameworks represent something more than just AI frameworks. They are designed to enable the creation of intelligent agents that can interact with users, other agents, and the environment to achieve specific goals. These agents can exhibit autonomous behavior, make decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. Let's look at some key capabilities enabled by AI Agent Frameworks:

- **Agent Collaboration and Coordination**: Enable the creation of multiple AI agents that can work together, communicate, and coordinate to solve complex tasks.
- **Task Automation and Management**: Provide mechanisms for automating multi-step workflows, task delegation, and dynamic task management among agents.
- **Contextual Understanding and Adaptation**: Equip agents with the ability to understand context, adapt to changing environments, and make decisions based on real-time information.

So in summary, agents allow you to do more, to take automation to the next level, to create more intelligent systems that can adapt and learn from their environment.

## How to quickly prototype, iterate, and improve the agent‚Äôs capabilities?

This is a fast-moving landscape, but there are some things that are common across most AI Agent Frameworks that can help you quickly prototype and iterate namely module components, collaborative tools, and real-time learning. Let's dive into these:

- **Use Modular Components**: AI SDKs offer pre-built components such as AI and Memory connectors, function calling using natural language or code plugins, prompt templates, and more.
- **Leverage Collaborative Tools**: Design agents with specific roles and tasks, enabling them to test and refine collaborative workflows.
- **Learn in Real-Time**: Implement feedback loops where agents learn from interactions and adjust their behavior dynamically.

### Use Modular Components

SDKs like Microsoft Semantic Kernel and LangChain offer pre-built components such as AI connectors, prompt templates, and memory management.

**How teams can use these**: Teams can quickly assemble these components to create a functional prototype without starting from scratch, allowing for rapid experimentation and iteration.

**How it works in practice**: You can use a pre-built parser to extract information from user input, a memory module to store and retrieve data, and a prompt generator to interact with users, all without having to build these components from scratch.

**Example code**. Let's look at examples of how you can use a pre-built AI Connector with Semantic Kernel Python and .Net that uses auto-function calling to have the model respond to user input:

``` python
# Semantic Kernel Python Example

import asyncio
from typing import Annotated

from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai import FunctionChoiceBehavior
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion, AzureChatPromptExecutionSettings
from semantic_kernel.contents import ChatHistory
from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function
from semantic_kernel.kernel import Kernel

# Define a ChatHistory object to hold the conversation's context
chat_history = ChatHistory()
chat_history.add_user_message("I'd like to go to New York on January 1, 2025")


# Define a sample plugin that contains the function to book travel
class BookTravelPlugin:
    """A Sample Book Travel Plugin"""

    @kernel_function(name="book_flight", description="Book travel given location and date")
    async def book_flight(
        self, date: Annotated[str, "The date of travel"], location: Annotated[str, "The location to travel to"]
    ) -> str:
        return f"Travel was booked to {location} on {date}"

# Create the Kernel
kernel = Kernel()

# Add the sample plugin to the Kernel object
kernel.add_plugin(BookTravelPlugin(), plugin_name="book_travel")

# Define the Azure OpenAI AI Connector
chat_service = AzureChatCompletion(
    deployment_name="YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME", 
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", 
    endpoint="https://<your-resource>.azure.openai.com/",
)

# Define the request settings to configure the model with auto-function calling
request_settings = AzureChatPromptExecutionSettings(function_choice_behavior=FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto())


async def main():
    # Make the request to the model for the given chat history and request settings
    # The Kernel contains the sample that the model will request to invoke
    response = await chat_service.get_chat_message_content(
        chat_history=chat_history, settings=request_settings, kernel=kernel
    )
    assert response is not None

    """
    Note: In the auto function calling process, the model determines it can invoke the 
    `BookTravelPlugin` using the `book_flight` function, supplying the necessary arguments. 
    
    For example:

    "tool_calls": [
        {
            "id": "call_abc123",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "BookTravelPlugin-book_flight",
                "arguments": "{'location': 'New York', 'date': '2025-01-01'}"
            }
        }
    ]

    Since the location and date arguments are required (as defined by the kernel function), if the 
    model lacks either, it will prompt the user to provide them. For instance:

    User: Book me a flight to New York.
    Model: Sure, I'd love to help you book a flight. Could you please specify the date?
    User: I want to travel on January 1, 2025.
    Model: Your flight to New York on January 1, 2025, has been successfully booked. Safe travels!
    """

    print(f"`{response}`")
    # Example AI Model Response: `Your flight to New York on January 1, 2025, has been successfully booked. Safe travels! ‚úàÔ∏èüóΩ`

    # Add the model's response to our chat history context
    chat_history.add_assistant_message(response.content)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
```csharp
// Semantic Kernel C# example

using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.ChatCompletion;
using System.ComponentModel;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.AzureOpenAI;

ChatHistory chatHistory = [];
chatHistory.AddUserMessage("I'd like to go to New York on January 1, 2025");

var kernelBuilder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
kernelBuilder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
    deploymentName: "NAME_OF_YOUR_DEPLOYMENT",
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    endpoint: "YOUR_AZURE_ENDPOINT"
);
kernelBuilder.Plugins.AddFromType<BookTravelPlugin>("BookTravel"); 
var kernel = kernelBuilder.Build();

var settings = new AzureOpenAIPromptExecutionSettings()
{
    FunctionChoiceBehavior = FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto()
};

var chatCompletion = kernel.GetRequiredService<IChatCompletionService>();

var response = await chatCompletion.GetChatMessageContentAsync(chatHistory, settings, kernel);

/*
Behind the scenes, the model recognizes the tool to call, what arguments it already has (location) and (date)
{

"tool_calls": [
    {
        "id": "call_abc123",
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "BookTravelPlugin-book_flight",
            "arguments": "{'location': 'New York', 'date': '2025-01-01'}"
        }
    }
]
*/

Console.WriteLine(response.Content);
chatHistory.AddMessage(response!.Role, response!.Content!);

// Example AI Model Response: Your flight to New York on January 1, 2025, has been successfully booked. Safe travels! ‚úàÔ∏èüóΩ

// Define a plugin that contains the function to book travel
public class BookTravelPlugin
{
    [KernelFunction("book_flight")]
    [Description("Book travel given location and date")]
    public async Task<string> BookFlight(DateTime date, string location)
    {
        return await Task.FromResult( $"Travel was booked to {location} on {date}");
    }
}
```

What you can see from this example is how you can leverage a pre-built parser to extract key information from user input, such as the origin, destination, and date of a flight booking request. This modular approach allows you to focus on the high-level logic.

### Leverage Collaborative Tools

Frameworks like CrewAI, Microsoft AutoGen, and Semantic Kernel facilitate the creation of multiple agents that can work together.

**How teams can use these**: Teams can design agents with specific roles and tasks, enabling them to test and refine collaborative workflows and improve overall system efficiency.

**How it works in practice**: You can create a team of agents where each agent has a specialized function, such as data retrieval, analysis, or decision-making. These agents can communicate and share information to achieve a common goal, such as answering a user query or completing a task.

**Example code (AutoGen)**:

```python
# creating agents, then create a round robin schedule where they can work together, in this case in order

# Data Retrieval Agent
# Data Analysis Agent
# Decision Making Agent

agent_retrieve = AssistantAgent(
    name="dataretrieval",
    model_client=model_client,
    tools=[retrieve_tool],
    system_message="Use tools to solve tasks."
)

agent_analyze = AssistantAgent(
    name="dataanalysis",
    model_client=model_client,
    tools=[analyze_tool],
    system_message="Use tools to solve tasks."
)

# conversation ends when user says "APPROVE"
termination = TextMentionTermination("APPROVE")

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent("user_proxy", input_func=input)

team = RoundRobinGroupChat([agent_retrieve, agent_analyze, user_proxy], termination_condition=termination)

stream = team.run_stream(task="Analyze data", max_turns=10)
# Use asyncio.run(...) when running in a script.
await Console(stream)
```

What you see in the previous code is how you can create a task that involves multiple agents working together to analyze data. Each agent performs a specific function, and the task is executed by coordinating the agents to achieve the desired outcome. By creating dedicated agents with specialized roles, you can improve task efficiency and performance.

### Learn in Real-Time

Advanced frameworks provide capabilities for real-time context understanding and adaptation.

**How teams can use these**: Teams can implement feedback loops where agents learn from interactions and adjust their behavior dynamically, leading to continuous improvement and refinement of capabilities.

**How it works in practice**: Agents can analyze user feedback, environmental data, and task outcomes to update their knowledge base, adjust decision-making algorithms, and improve performance over time. This iterative learning process enables agents to adapt to changing conditions and user preferences, enhancing overall system effectiveness.

## What are the differences between the frameworks AutoGen and Semantic Kernel?

There are many ways to compare these frameworks, but let's look at some key differences in terms of their design, capabilities, and target use cases:

## AutoGen

AutoGen is an open-source framework developed by Microsoft Research's AI Frontiers Lab. It focuses on event-driven, distributed *agentic* applications, enabling multiple LLMs and SLMs, tools, and advanced multi-agent design patterns.

AutoGen is built around the core concept of agents, which are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Agents communicate through asynchronous messages, allowing them to work independently and in parallel, enhancing system scalability and responsiveness.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="_blank">Agents are based on the actor model</a>. According to Wikipedia, an actor is _the basic building block of concurrent computation. In response to a message it receives, an actor can: make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received_.

**Use Cases**: Automating code generation, data analysis tasks, and building custom agents for planning and research functions.

Here are some important core concepts of AutoGen:

- **Agents**. An agent is a software entity that:
  - **Communicates via messages**, these messages can be synchronous or asynchronous.
  - **Maintains its own state**, which can be modified by incoming messages.
  - **Performs actions** in response to received messages or changes in its state. These actions may modify the agent‚Äôs state and produce external effects, such as updating message logs, sending new messages, executing code, or making API calls.
    
  Here you have a short code snippet in which you create your own agent with Chat capabilities:

    ```python
    from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
    from autogen_agentchat.messages import TextMessage
    from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient


    class MyAssistant(RoutedAgent):
        def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
            super().__init__(name)
            model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")
            self._delegate = AssistantAgent(name, model_client=model_client)
    
        @message_handler
        async def handle_my_message_type(self, message: MyMessageType, ctx: MessageContext) -> None:
            print(f"{self.id.type} received message: {message.content}")
            response = await self._delegate.on_messages(
                [TextMessage(content=message.content, source="user")], ctx.cancellation_token
            )
            print(f"{self.id.type} responded: {response.chat_message.content}")
    ```
    
    In the previous code, `MyAssistant` has been created and inherits from `RoutedAgent`. It has a message handler that prints the content of the message and then sends a response using the `AssistantAgent` delegate. Especially note how we assign to `self._delegate` an instance of `AssistantAgent` which is a pre-built agent that can handle chat completions.


    Let's let AutoGen know about this agent type and kick off the program next:

    ```python
    
    # main.py
    runtime = SingleThreadedAgentRuntime()
    await MyAgent.register(runtime, "my_agent", lambda: MyAgent())

    runtime.start()  # Start processing messages in the background.
    await runtime.send_message(MyMessageType("Hello, World!"), AgentId("my_agent", "default"))
    ```

    In the previous code the agents are registered with the runtime and then a message is sent to the agent resulting in the following output:

    ```text
    # Output from the console:
    my_agent received message: Hello, World!
    my_assistant received message: Hello, World!
    my_assistant responded: Hello! How can I assist you today?
    ```

- **Multi agents**. AutoGen supports the creation of multiple agents that can work together to achieve complex tasks. Agents can communicate, share information, and coordinate their actions to solve problems more efficiently. To create a multi-agent system, you can define different types of agents with specialized functions and roles, such as data retrieval, analysis, decision-making, and user interaction. Let's see how such a creation looks like so we get a sense of it:

    ```python
    editor_description = "Editor for planning and reviewing the content."

    # Example of declaring an Agent
    editor_agent_type = await EditorAgent.register(
    runtime,
    editor_topic_type,  # Using topic type as the agent type.
    lambda: EditorAgent(
        description=editor_description,
        group_chat_topic_type=group_chat_topic_type,
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
            model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
            # api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        ),
        ),
    )

    # remaining declarations shortened for brevity

    # Group chat
    group_chat_manager_type = await GroupChatManager.register(
    runtime,
    "group_chat_manager",
    lambda: GroupChatManager(
        participant_topic_types=[writer_topic_type, illustrator_topic_type, editor_topic_type, user_topic_type],
        model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
            model="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
            # api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
        ),
        participant_descriptions=[
            writer_description, 
            illustrator_description, 
            editor_description, 
            user_description
        ],
        ),
    )
    ```

    In the previous code we have a `GroupChatManager` that is registered with the runtime. This manager is responsible for coordinating the interactions between different types of agents, such as writers, illustrators, editors, and users.

- **Agent Runtime**. The framework provides a runtime environment, enabling communication between agents, manages their identities and lifecycles, and enforce security and privacy boundaries. This means that you can run your agents in a secure and controlled environment, ensuring that they can interact safely and efficiently. There are two runtimes of interest:
  - **Stand-alone runtime**. This is a good choice for single-process applications where all agents are implemented in the same programming language and run in the same process. Here's an illustration of how it works:
  
    <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/_images/architecture-standalone.svg" target="_blank">Stand-alone runtime</a>   
Application stack

    *agents communicate via messages through the runtime, and the runtime manages the lifecycle of agents*

  - **Distributed agent runtime**, is suitable for multi-process applications where agents may be implemented in different programming languages and running on different machines. Here's an illustration of how it works:
  
    <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/_images/architecture-distributed.svg" target="_blank">Distributed runtime</a>

## Semantic Kernel + Agent Framework

Semantic Kernel is an enterprise-ready AI Orchestration SDK. It consists of AI and memory connectors, along with an Agent Framework.

Let's first cover some core components:

- **AI Connectors**: This is an interface with external AI services and data sources for use in both Python and C#.

  ```python
  # Semantic Kernel Python
  from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion
  from semantic_kernel.kernel import Kernel

  kernel = Kernel()
  kernel.add_service(
    AzureChatCompletion(
        deployment_name="your-deployment-name",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        endpoint="your-endpoint",
    )
  )
  ```  

    ```csharp
    // Semantic Kernel C#
    using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

    // Create kernel
    var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
    
    // Add a chat completion service:
    builder.Services.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
        "your-resource-name",
        "your-endpoint",
        "your-resource-key",
        "deployment-model");
    var kernel = builder.Build();
    ```

    Here you have a simple example of how you can create a kernel and add a chat completion service. Semantic Kernel creates a connection to an external AI service, in this case, Azure OpenAI Chat Completion.

- **Plugins**: These encapsulate functions that an application can use. There are both ready-made plugins and custom ones you can create. A related concept is "prompt functions." Instead of providing natural language cues for function invocation, you broadcast certain functions to the model. Based on the current chat context, the model may choose to call one of these functions to complete a request or query. Here's an example:

  ```python
  from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai.services.azure_chat_completion import AzureChatCompletion


  async def main():
      from semantic_kernel.functions import KernelFunctionFromPrompt
      from semantic_kernel.kernel import Kernel

      kernel = Kernel()
      kernel.add_service(AzureChatCompletion())

      user_input = input("User Input:> ")

      kernel_function = KernelFunctionFromPrompt(
          function_name="SummarizeText",
          prompt="""
          Summarize the provided unstructured text in a sentence that is easy to understand.
          Text to summarize: {{$user_input}}
          """,
      )

      response = await kernel_function.invoke(kernel=kernel, user_input=user_input)
      print(f"Model Response: {response}")

      """
      Sample Console Output:

      User Input:> I like dogs
      Model Response: The text expresses a preference for dogs.
      """


  if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
  ```

    ```csharp
    var userInput = Console.ReadLine();

    // Define semantic function inline.
    string skPrompt = @"Summarize the provided unstructured text in a sentence that is easy to understand.
                        Text to summarize: {{$userInput}}";
    
    // create the function from the prompt
    KernelFunction summarizeFunc = kernel.CreateFunctionFromPrompt(
        promptTemplate: skPrompt,
        functionName: "SummarizeText"
    );

    //then import into the current kernel
    kernel.ImportPluginFromFunctions("SemanticFunctions", [summarizeFunc]);

    ```

    Here, you first have a template prompt `skPrompt` that leaves room for the user to input text, `$userInput`. Then you create the kernel function `SummarizeText` and then import it into the kernel with the plugin name `SemanticFunctions`. Note the name of the function that helps Semantic Kernel understand what the function does and when it should be called.

- **Native function**: There's also native functions that the framework can call directly to carry out the task. Here's an example of such a function retrieving the content from a file:

    ```csharp
    public class NativeFunctions {

        [SKFunction, Description("Retrieve content from local file")]
        public async Task<string> RetrieveLocalFile(string fileName, int maxSize = 5000)
        {
            string content = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(fileName);
            if (content.Length <= maxSize) return content;
            return content.Substring(0, maxSize);
        }
    }
    
    //Import native function
    string plugInName = "NativeFunction";
    string functionName = "RetrieveLocalFile";

   //To add the functions to a kernel use the following function
    kernel.ImportPluginFromType<NativeFunctions>();

    ```

- **Memory**:  Abstracts and simplifies context management for AI apps. The idea with memory is that this is something the LLM should know about. You can store this information in a vector store which ends up being an in-memory database or a vector database or similar. Here's an example of a very simplified scenario where *facts* are added to the memory:

    ```csharp
    var facts = new Dictionary<string,string>();
    facts.Add(
        "Azure Machine Learning; https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/",
        @"Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and
        managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals,
        data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows"
    );
    
    facts.Add(
        "Azure SQL Service; https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/",
        @"Azure SQL is a family of managed, secure, and intelligent products
        that use the SQL Server database engine in the Azure cloud."
    );
    
    string memoryCollectionName = "SummarizedAzureDocs";
    
    foreach (var fact in facts) {
        await memoryBuilder.SaveReferenceAsync(
            collection: memoryCollectionName,
            description: fact.Key.Split(";")[1].Trim(),
            text: fact.Value,
            externalId: fact.Key.Split(";")[2].Trim(),
            externalSourceName: "Azure Documentation"
        );
    }
    ```

    These facts are then stored in the memory collection `SummarizedAzureDocs`. This is a very simplified example, but you can see how you can store information in the memory for the LLM to use.


## What's the difference between these frameworks?
 
It does sound like there is a lot of overlap between these frameworks, but there are some key differences in terms of their design, capabilities, and target use cases:
 
- **AutoGen**: Is an experimentation framework focused on leading-edge research on multi-agent systems. It is the best place to experiment and prototype sophisticated multi-agent systems.
- **Semantic Kernel**: Is a production-ready agent library for building enterprise agentic applications. Focuses on event-driven, distributed agentic applications, enabling multiple LLMs and SLMs, tools, and single/multi-agent design patterns.
 
Let's summarize the key differences in a table:

| Framework | Focus | Core Concepts | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AutoGen | Event-driven, distributed agentic applications | Agents, Personas, Functions, Data | Code generation, data analysis tasks |
| Semantic Kernel | Understanding and generating human-like text content | Agents, Modular Components, Collaboration | Natural language understanding, content generation |
